Some rotation will be necessary sometimes, but try to minimize it. Imagine the phone is mounted on a straight horizontal rail and can only slide."/>

                <Label Text="There is an experimental &quot;guide donut/dot&quot; on the settings page you can turn on which may help you keep your perspectives parallel for a large scene. Ideally you would drag it onto the horizon, sky, or other very distant point. Be careful, using it on smaller scenes will make things painful."/>
