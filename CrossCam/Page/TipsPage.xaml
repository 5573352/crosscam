The key is to crop the right edge of the left picture slightly past what the right edge of the right picture shows of the scene and vice-versa. Adding a border is toggled in the settings. If this is confusing, just tap a whole bunch on the inside edge crop button and it will start to be clear. That crop button looks like this:"/>
